Welcome to Packard Level 1! My name is Michael (he/him pronouns), a fifth-year resident and third-year Senior Resident (SR) studying Master of National Security Policy. I'm incredibly excited to be your **Senior Resident (SR)** this year!

## Who am I?

Originally from Shanghai 上海, China, I came to Australia 10 years ago. My family initially settled in the western suburbs of Melbourne.

I was deciding solely between UniMelb and Monash before I attended ANU's Open Day back in 2017. Moving to Canberra wasn't easy for me: I have never lived away from home before, and no one from my school came here. It was extremely daunting at first.

Now that five years have passed by, Bruce has become my home. Surrounded by friends who care deeply about me and whom I care deeply about, there is no place I'd rather be.

## What is a SR?

A Senior Resident, or SR for short, is the student leader responsible for your pastoral care needs on your floor. I will be your main point of contact if you have any concerns about living at Bruce or your study at the ANU. We are trained in first aid and mental health first aid, and we are trusted members of our community.

Please don't hesitate to come to us; we are always happy for a chat!
