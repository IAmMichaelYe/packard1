## COVID-19 protections

We are RATing tomorrow morning again! Send me a photo with your result, you know the drill.

Thanks to everyone for following public health directions so far. Your mates and neighbours at Bruce are staying healthy because of you.

### Masks

ANU will continue to have an indoor mask mandate. We live in a high-risk environment, alongside people who may be immunocompromised or suffering from underlying health conditions. Wear a mask and let's keep each other safe.

### In-person events

Unfortunately, in-person events are still banned on campus. Pod meetings will be online until we get the all-clear from ACT Health. If you have off-campus events you want to attend, that's your judgment call. Just make sure you stay safe.

### If you develop symptoms

If you develop cold- or flu-like symptoms, you will need to complete a PCR test.

### If you test positive

If you test positive, just take a breath, send me a text, and complete the two forms sent to you via email earlier.

We are delivering meals for Packard ressies as well. If you didn't get a meal, call Duty SR and they will help sort it out.

On your last day of isolation, you will get a Certificate of Release from ACT Health. It will generally say 11:59pm is the time you can come out of isolation.


## What's on in Canberra

The Night Noodle Markets is on this week and ending soon. The Englighten Festival will be on soon. Make sure to check them out, especially if you are new to Canberra!

## Duty SR

Do NOT call Duty SR to pick up your food delivery (e.g. UberEats, Coles). If you are in isolation, get a friend to pick it up and deliver to your door.

## Pod function

We have a small pod budget. It can be used to run subsidised pod functions every term. We are exploring the option of a movie night. Send me other suggestions if you have them.

## The end

Thanks for reading everyone! Have a great Week 2!
